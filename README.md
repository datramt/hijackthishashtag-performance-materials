# hijackthishashtag-performance-materials

hijackthishashtag extends a video-scrubbing engine built by Dan Tramte called "tA/v\Am." It requires a DJ-HERO controller to scrub through the media. 

Due to change in frame-calling methods in Max 7, it is recommended that the performer uses Max 6 (or Max 6 runtime) 

The media that is to be scrubbed scrubbed is a large video fileâ€”too large to upload here, so please place this video in the the folder titled hashtagtavam:
